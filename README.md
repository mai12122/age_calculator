## 📌 PROJECT TITLE

**AGE CALCULATOR – CALCULATE EXACT AGE FROM DATE OF BIRTH**


## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

To build a simple, interactive **JavaScript Age Calculator** that lets users input their date of birth and calculates their current age in years, months, and days. This tool is built to demonstrate the use of date manipulation in JavaScript and DOM interaction.


## ⚙️ HOW IT WORKS

### 🧩 Workflow:

1. The user selects their **birth date** using an HTML `<input type="date">` element.
2. When the **"Calculate"** button is clicked:
   - JavaScript retrieves the input date.
   - The app calculates the difference between the current date and the birth date.
   - The result (in years, months, and days) is displayed below.

### 💡 Key Features:
- Prevents future dates.
- Includes input validation.
- Displays precise age breakdown.
- Responsive design.
